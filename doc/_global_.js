 * Reads a file as a whole.

 * Files can be split into an array when reading the file. It is

 * a file larger than the available memory will most probably crash
 * the program. Strictly speaking only reading ascii fils make sense.
 * Also gzip'ed files are supported.
 *
 * Note that this is only meant for debugging purpose and should
 * not be usd in a production environment. Scripts should not
 * access any files by defaults. If external values have to be
 * provided arguments should be given to the script.
 *
 * @static
 *
 * @param {String} name
 *    Name of the file to read. The base directory is the current
 *    working directory
 *
 * @param {String} [delim=undefined]
 *    A delimiter used to split the file into an array. If provided
 *    it must be a String of length 1.
 *
 * @returns {String,Array[String]}
 *    If no delimiter is given, a StringObject with the file (read
 *    until \0) is returned. If a delimiter is given, an array

 *    contain the property 'name' with the file name and the array
